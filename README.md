# Clickthrough-rate-prediction
In this project we have attempted to create a comparative analysis of three approaches that namely include : 1. Logistic Regression 2. Bayesian Network 3. Support Vector Machine with one hot encoding
In order to implement all three models we used an advertising dataset from kaggle with
information such as date , age , ad topic line , etc .We have implemented and analysed all three
models in order to find a more suitable model to predict user click through rate for targeted
advertising as Clickthrough rate and probability of click is an important metric in advertising.
Predicting this metric is beneficial for ad providers to increase the quality of targeted
advertising.
Accurate and precise prediction of such metrics can lead to a more unobtrusive and
pleasurable experience for the customer as well as the advertising company. Instead of
instantly clicking away from an ad for a useless product, bespoke adverts for customers will
actually increase sales. Customers would buy products that they think they need and click
through rate is one of the factors in determining what kind of products a customer is really
looking for.
